# LocalPlaylist
So it turns out that if you create a playlist on YouTube, it messes with your video suggestions. I found this incredibly annoying, so I decided to create a program that lets me keep my YouTube playlists on my computer instead of on YouTube.

&nbsp;

Current features:
* Add and delete videos, rearrange videos in the list, and save/load the list to/from a file.
* Can handle any YouTube video's URL, whether youtube.com or youtu.be.
* Open the playlist as a temporary HTML file in your default browser, formatted to look just like a YouTube playlist.
* You can use a playlist file as a command-line argument to immediately open it in your browser.
* A "Help" button that tells you what all the buttons do.

&nbsp;

Possible future features:
* Adding an asterisk to the title when the current playlist has unsaved changes, so you won't forget to click "Save". Maybe also a prompt asking if you're sure you want to quit if you try to close the window with unsaved changes.
* The ability to add multiple videos to the playlist at once.
* Support for sites other than YouTube.
